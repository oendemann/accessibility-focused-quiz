## About The Project

FreeCodeCamp web design course project that focuses on accessibility features within CSS and HTML. Compared to previous projects, this project had a stronger focus on independent design choices and less obvious instructions.

## Built With

* **HTML:** Used for the structure and organization of webpage (e.g. nesting inputs inside labels inside sections, etc).
* **CSS:** Used to refine the look of webpage (indentation, coloring, etc).

## What I Learned

1. CSS selectors can be setup in various ways (e.g. "footer a" vs "footer > a", etc).
2. CSS can be used to control how more than I imagined at first (e.g. how a mouse reacts when hovering over a link, etc).
3. I've found that it may be helpful to id most variables in some way (whether that be with "id=" or "class=") for easier fine-tuning when nesting becomes more expansive.
